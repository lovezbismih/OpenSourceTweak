# Barmoji

Barmoji adds a selectable emoji view between the globe and dictations buttons on iPhone X's.

This is how Apple should have used the extra space on the iPhone X keyboard instead of the empty space they went with.

### Installing

Barmoji is available on public repo https://repo.cpdigitaldarkroom.com with the full width option and custom emojis disabled. The unlocked version can be installed from my supporter repo available at https://supporter.cpdigitaldarkroom.com/repo/ This repo can only be accessed after a one-time access fee to help fund more open source software.
