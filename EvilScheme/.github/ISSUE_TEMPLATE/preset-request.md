**Preset destination**
The app you want links to open in. E.g. Google Maps

**Preset target**
That app's stock counterpart. E.g. Apple Maps

**URL Scheme Info**
Have you found any info about the URL scheme support for the destination? If it does not have URL scheme or universal link support: sorry, I can't add support for it.
