A full manual for operation can be found [here](https://l.pane.net/evil.html)

Installation
---
You can install EvilScheme for free by adding the [Dynastic Repo](http://repo.dynastic.co) to your favorite package manager. It can also be compiled from source using [Theos](https://theos.dev) or [DragonBuild](https://github.com/DragonBuild/DragonBuild). Makefiles for both are provided in this repo. You may need to build EvilKit separately first and add it to your build system's framework include directory. Debs are also avalible directly from Github under the `Releases` tab.

Contribution
---
I love pull requests! To contribute, just fork, branch, commit, push, and send me a PR. Please ensure that your code fits with the style of the project and is well documented with comments. If you have and questions, shoot me a DM. If you want to add a preset, modify the `EVSPreferenceManager.m` file with your preset from source. Each item is structured similarly to its counterpart in the settings pane. If you don't quite remember the behavior of each portion, check out the well documented headers [here](https://github.com/LorenzoPane/EvilScheme/blob/master/EvilKit/src/EVKURLPortions.h).
